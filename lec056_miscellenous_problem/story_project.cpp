    There is always a moster fear in the child who sleep alone
    First thing i want to know why these parent want there children need
    to sleep in a seperate room ,may be because they are very much inspired by the 
    western culture.
    so, at the night when it was the time for sleeping the father came to check the room
    to say him good night, when he came in he felt very unusual as he felt something wrong
    here didn't mind he say to himself , may be because a little bit of headache which he was
    suffering from morning was the reason for such unsuallness.
    so when he say his son good night he sees his son was a little pale and was grining,
    he again said good night to the son and the son pointed out to under the bed,
    the father knew there was nothing in there but for satisfaction he looked there,
    to his surprise when he looked there it was his own son saying ,'papa there is someone
    on my bed'.
